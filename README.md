# React + Vite

This is a react app to find recipe based on ingredients provided by the user. This project uses Hugging Face's [Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) model to suggest recipes based on a list of ingredients provided by the user. It makes an API call to Hugging Face's Inference API.
